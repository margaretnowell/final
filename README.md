# DailyVibes

DailyVibes is a simple mood and energy tracking web application. Users can log quick "vibe" entries (category, rating, and notes), see a list of their recent vibes, and visualize average ratings for each category using interactive charts.

The app is built as a full-stack web application for the INST377 final project, with a React-based front end, a Node.js / Express backend, and a Supabase database for persistent storage.
